# Dear Visitor!

  
WIP  
  
This is a demonstartion, to check, what are the capabilities of this free CMS and template.

In this blogpost, I will explore the features of this editor

1. I can create ordered lists
2. This is No.2

* I can also create unordered list
* Sadly, it can only be bullets

### I can enlarge the text. This is heading 3

**Bold,** _Italic, **Bold-Italic**_

I can create [LINK](https://www.google.com)-s.

This is a codeblock:

    function henlo() {
    	console.log("Henlo")
    }

This is an image:

![flower](/content/images/igor-son-FV_PxCqgtwc-unsplash.jpg "Nice flower")

I can add title, and alt only.
